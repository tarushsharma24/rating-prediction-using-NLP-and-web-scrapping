# rating-prediction-using-NLP-and-web-scrapping
i performed web scrapping on flipkart to get 3600 users data. The scrapped data included reviews and ratings given by users to a particular smartphone. i created .csv file to store the rectified data on my device. i then performed Natural Language Processing on the reviews to reduce the no. of words and to get their term frequency, inverse term frequency. i used NLTK library for NLP. Based on the TF and ITF of these reduced words a machine learning model was created to predict ratings. Multinomial naive bayes was used for machine learning. it gave me an accuracy of 73.11%. The accuracy could be easily improved by changing the page numbers in the code. by increasing the number of pages more data will be collected from flipkart that will improve the machine learning model and will increase its accuracy.
