8,5,"Best in the market!1) Delivery on time, Properly packed with bill copy2) In the box POCO has Mobile (Tempered glass pre installed), Charger, Transparent case cover and Manual.3) Out of the box, visually the phone looks appealing. Rear camera placement and design choice looks good on the phone. 4a) To touch and feel, the rear of the phone feels more like plastic but at the same time it also feels rigid and non slippery cause of the design texture the material offers. 4b) For a big battery it carries, it ..."

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment...."

29,2,Expected a better productAfter around 1 month of usage-Even though its a budget phone the intial days Mi Note  3 worked well than this. It sometimes get hanged and when I tried to download a 1 gb file from internet. It restarted itself.So performance wise not good.Nothing is great. Can't have a Google feed normally also.Feeling likw giving it back
30,5,Fabulous!Poco m3 mobile products are good  i am happy Camara quality is good and battry  performance exillent Sound quality very good
31,4,DelightfulIt's a value for money product.. But if you r a photography Anthusiast then this phone is definitely not for you.. Pubg works fine so you can play games no doubt. Battery is awesome. I deducted 1star only because in this price segment we might find better phones from realme.
32,4,Very GoodFirst I say flikart very vast one day delivery I'm impressed. Phone nice colorCase also worthy. Battery backup nice. Camera not bad 👍(may be they any software updates it's get better performance). I'm vary happy with poco m3I'm satisfied value for money.

34,3,"Does the jobThe phone looks like very good and also i liked the MI Launcher very much. But, other thinks are average.I didn't expect this type of camera, camera is very poor... The phone Heating is a big problem and also charger. When you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal.. I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3"

36,1,WorthlessPOCO M3 is good  phone  but it have a very cheapest display the colors of display  is very  bad many times  its display  gave the some  issues. It is not even  good for childrens.The processor ram and camera is very  good  but display  is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app
37,2,Not goodIf u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung). This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect. A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button
38,1,Don't waste your moneyHorrible phoneWhy? 1-It heat up while charging and playing games2- Phone sensitive very less 3- there's no hands free call in game turbo so it's a pain in the neck when call came while playing games4- 4GB ram works faster than this pathetic 6GB ram5- you cannot tap forward or backward while watching YouTube but have to drag the player every time which is disgusting6-  battery never last as how it mention in the specification (4000 mah is better )and to fully charge it took almost 4 hou...

Poco has to improve this camera quality issue.. But rest of all things are best.."
40,4,"DelightfulI find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con: 1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices."

Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1.

50,3,"Just okayI'll give this mobile to 3.5  rating  because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi..."

52,4,Value-for-moneyTwo biggest cons:- 1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime. 2) Camera is pathetic. PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.
53,5,"Great productHi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,"

55,4,"Worth the moneyMy real review after 10 days of use-battery heat up more when it goes from 15 to 40 then normal heat up till 75. Then no heat up. Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good. It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal. If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may. All over it is a good phone under 10,000."

Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

73,4,"Good choiceI m  writing this review after using one month of Poco M3. Camera -  is little disappointed coz not having wide angle lense, one camera is 48 mega pixel. Battery - is very good charged in 2 hrs and backup for 2 days. Display - is good Full hd. Touch - is little disappointed. Speaker - is very good & loud, clear, dual speaker. Side fingure print scanner - is not fast just slow action. IR blast - is good working for remote function. Gaming - not for using high gaming."
74,5,"Fabulous!Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice."
75,5,Highly recommendedawesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys

78,3,"NiceI bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users."
79,5,"BrilliantThe phone is stunning look with great designThe charging time is little bit highCamera is perfect in day mode and good in night with night mode ,not better in night comparing to daylight.Front camera is fine with 8mp.Display ,sound and touch is amazingIt's better phone in this price segmentMostly i like the unique design"
80,5,"Worth every pennyThis is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK."

82,5,"Worth every pennyUsing Poco m3 for the past two months. It's a very good phone at this price range. The stock camera app is not so great. I suggest you to use Google cam, It can produce great results. Camera quality is very good when capturing photos using gcam. Battery will last more than 10hrs screen on time on normal usage. Performance wise also good. Value for money 💰"
83,4,DelightfulAll the features in this phone are  good but then you plug your phone in charging your phone will be heating . But a student without any doubt to buy it. It is very  good for student because in this camera had a document  option to capture clean and clear document.             Thanks poco m3
84,3,"Decent productPOCO M3 is surely worth the money. Considering the price point, the display is good. Battery life is excellent. It can last for an average of 2 days for a normal user. The camera department is ok. The primary cam is fairly good but the edge detection is poor coming to human subjects. Overall, this phone is a good option if you a kind of lite user."
85,5,"Great productDecent phone in this price range, Camara quality is above expections but can't be compared with flagship range, display quality is great but simultaneously not handy due to jumbo screen size, performance is good but not great something faced lags in opening app in 6gb variant. Battery backup is great, 2 day Last easily in normal usage,Overall satisfied, fulfilling the requirement very well.About review is based on one month usage."
86,3,"Does the jobGood product , I bought this product for 10500 , 6 gb ram is there but it doesnt feel I have 6 gb ram inside bit slow on processing , I have samsung M31 which I bought 2 years back , still it clearly outshines this Poco M3 , but definitely worth it for 10k , because good battery , good looks , 6 gb ram at this price range with lot of other features"
87,4,Nice productPhone is running nice. But the processor should be better like Mi phones. Battery life is satisfactory. Camera is good in pro mode. But no front flash for selfie. White screen light is all for selfie. Overall it is a good product.

There are preinstalled apps which consume storage space. But fortunately we can uninstall it. 😄Camera. I see many reviews saying worst camera experience. But i didnt felt like that.

90,5,"Mind-blowing purchaseThis phone is the best budget phone around 10k right now.There are 4 main reasons which make this phone better than the ones available in the same price range. These reasons are :1. 6GB RAM2. Snapdragon 662 Processor3. Full HD Display4. 6000 mAh BatteryYou can check and compare with other phones, all of them won't have the above four things or maybe have only one of the four.So, based on my usage of this device and due to the above reasons, I would recommend everyone looking for a p..."
91,4,Pretty goodGood phone but is not a big gaming phone. Camera is average at this price. Battery also good for Normal use. Charging time is 50% 1h 30m. If you looking to buy for normal use and small game it's good.for ultra gaming is not good. Thank you flipkart for the fastest delivery
92,5,Classy productGood phone considering the price.Camera is OK.Not very bad.You cannot get better than this in this price.Performance wise phone is good.little slower than my last used phone samsung galaxy A50s.However this phone can run lot off applications seamlessly without any lag.You can play games in it but dont expact super smooth experience.Overall it is a good budget friendly phone.

99,5,"AwesomeFelling awesome. Thanks flipkart. I received this mobile for 10k and before 24 hour's deliver, really too good and fully satisfied. Really too much worth mobile. It's is genuine feedback. After using few days, I'm going to give feedback. Concerns: finger print, Mobile weight No rich look. Back up is too worest, they given 64GB storage. Pro's: performance, Camera quality back side just ok. Battery backup more than 48 hours. Finally review is too good, really too worthy mobile."
100,5,"Perfect product!I am not a gamer, so I know nothing about gaming performance. But the performance is so far so good when it comes to battery life. It's definitely a game player at this price with such battery back up. Coming to the cameras, I think they are decent and value for money. There are minor lags and may be it is because of MI's aggressive RAM management. At times, I felt that the touch calibration is not accurate enough. However that may change with the user. And when it comes to heating I haven't ..."

104,5,"Best Value for Money Smartphone.Awesome product. I have been using the device for three days; satisfactory camera quality, processing speed is mind blowing, games mostly run at High settings, awesome display, breathtaking stereo sound from the loud built in speakers, good connectivity, no such issues with privacy. Comes with minimum bloatware which could be uninstalled.   Over all  a Value for Money Product. I got it for INR 8,100. According to the price tag and my preferences it is the Best smartphone available."
105,3,"FairIt is okay but a huge improvement should be done basic feauters like call recording is missing... Litlle bit lazy in processing, camera is also not good as compared to mobiles of this price range included both front and rear. Has dual speakers but the second speaker is of no use as it has very low volume level and sometimes while playing audio main speaker collapse and only 2nd top speaker gives audio with a very low volume dont know why it is then we have to restart it"
106,5,"Worth every pennythe phone is very good at this rate  for daily use it is best phone in this rate, about its camera descent quality in this rate , but still some issue . phones battery is monster. its soooo amazing I really love it .  but its charging time it took is too much, but its a big battery so its ok .its good for gaming but about pubg its not much good . gyro didn't work probably its the only problem I face and all the phone is awesome."
107,5,"Highly recommendedMobile is absolutely fantastic and is best to buy if one's budget within 11k, overall performance is good along with a good battery life makes it really worth purchasing."
108,5,Just wow!Bought it for 11.5k including insurance.Battery is awesome. 12 hrs of screen on time Processor is good enough for Multi tasking day to day tasks6 gb ram and ufs 2.2 will make things very smooth actuallyNot much for gaming heavy gamesCamera is decent for this price pointUI is shiitt . Typical MIUI.So using other launcherLooks are really good and build quality is top notch at this price range.Dual speakers are very goodNo heating issues4.5/5 for this price range.Go for it

111,5,"Best in the market!I was in the lookout for a good phone for my father and thankfully I came to know about this product through one of my friend. Poco M3 was a good buy.I have to admit, the camera even though its 48megapixel, I'm not sure if it does the job properly as the quality of the image is under par ! The varient that I bought for my dad was the 6gb + 128 gb and I must say this is a very smooth transition for him considering his old phone. The  battery life is awesome, on an average my dad can use hi..."
112,5,"Classy productThe Poco M3 is more than just its premium looks. It offers much more for an affordable price point including excellent battery life, decent performance, 6GB RAM, a crisp FHD+ display, and a stereo speaker setup. It is a great option to consider under 15K, especially for users that are scouring the market for a smartphone not only performs well but also looks great."
113,5,WonderfulI am using this phone from last 7 days and the one thing I notice js battery performance it's excellent I am totally satisfied with the battery. Although I faced lag sometimes due to MIUI 12 and also the camera is not upto the mark there is an camera update needed here but the speaker and display quality is best in segment. 6 GB ram and the looks of this phone is very strong point for buying. As per my experience this is the best phone one can have and everyone should go for it if your budget...
114,5,Simply awesomeOverall the review of the phone is quite good and I want to say that I liked it quite well for that I want to add that the camera must provide a very good performance and after that ok it is good it is best for me because I have paid nearly 12000 rupees and the product is very very greater than worth it
115,4,"Nice productEverything is good, good battery, amazing display, value for money processor and it's a very good phone for day to day use (except gaming) and final about camera is rear camera is price worthy but front camera is not good in night with low light (single bulb) so if you want to enjoy online content on it gooooo for it but not for gaming at High or selfie"
116,4,WonderfulNice quality productsPerformance average as it is an stock androidBattery backup nice i like itDisplay a little more than averageCamera not so gud of front but the rear camera is gud for sure Overall at the price value it is a decent product
117,4,"Pretty goodI bought this phone same day on it's launched in India. It's a good mobile with fast charging and brilliant battery backup.. Camera quality is fine, it has automatic filter in the front camera which I don't like. It gets hot fast while playing games so it is good that I'm not a games lover, however, my kids play games on it and I keeps worrying of them... I have given 4 stars because battery backup and fast charging was the priority."
118,3,"Decent productBattery backup is very good but charging is very slow I think company are cheating us to show fast charging option is  available with it. Rear camera is average but front camera is not upto expectations. Operating performances is good  no heating issue observed. Weight is slightly higher sound quality and loudness is just average. Instead of soft case if provided headphone with it shall be better. Overall I will give rating for battery backup 5/5, charging-1/5, camera quality- 3/5, sound..."

602,5,TerrificGifted this to my mom. She loved it.
603,4,"DelightfulThe device is good in this price segment, what I personally fee, is the charger, that came in the box, is not so okay, as when I charge the phone with my old charger (POCO F1), the charging time is significantly low, it takes 70-80minutes to charge the phone from 10%-90%, however, when I use the in box charger, it takes 120-130 minutes for the same, other than that, everything is good."
604,4,Nice productGood budget phone
605,1,"Useless productHorrible. I got this phone because Poco claims to give ""clean experience"", ads free experience. Thats what stands it out from competitors. But after 4-5 months, it now frequently shows ads...... I've tried everything, but ads won't stop popping up! Shame on you Poco for fake claims!"

Overpriced with these draw backs."

2915,5,Simply awesomeCamera quality is best for this price I love this product it's yellow colour is attract now is my fvrt
2916,5,WonderfulFirstly design it's absolutely amazing and the good thing is they went for the plastic leather back instead of glass which is very handy and anti slippery. Performace is good at its price range. If u are looking for hardcore gaming I would like to suggest to buy mid range smartphones with higher processor. These kind of smartphones are best suited for elderly people.If u have one gift them they'll love it.

Flipkart as expected refuses to refund the amount or do any replacement. Phone battery backup sucks. Out of two 4G slots only one slot works. When I use two sims, only one is detected, another slot shows no sim. The phone hangs most of the time. - The speaker volume is too low. I can hardly hear the other person's voice unless I use headphones.- Camera quality is very poor. - Overall..."

But some video streaming apps like twitch, YouTube etc can get stuck especially when switching between landscape n portrait mode. The phone is quite fast for its price range. Other con is in landscape mode the display doesn't go till the end of the screen, there is a 1 mm gap where display is not seen, I noticed this while using twitch for dota 2, won't matter..."

The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...
